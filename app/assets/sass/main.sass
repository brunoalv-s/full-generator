// 1-Settings: global variables, such as brand colours, configs etc
// 2-Tools: mixins and helper functions
// 3-Generic: ground zero styles, reset styles such as normalize.css
// 4-Elements: a.k.a. Base, unclassed html elements, e.g. headings, lists, tables, this is the last layer that styles tag selectors
// 5-Objects:  no cosmetic design patterns. Class only styles from here onwards. Classes here are loosely named and I start doing OOCSS here (e.g. .button, .list-item, grid systems etc)
// 6-Components: rich design UI styling. Class names here are more specific. This layer usually has the biggest volume
// 7a-Themes: if applicable, thematic styles are placed here (e.g. seasonal Christmas theme)
// 7-Trumps: utilities, helpers and overrides. !important is often used.
